   <p> cats are the obvious pick becuase they are independant intelligent creatures. they are very fun to watch and play with</p>

   <p> cats are also less work to take care of. you don't have to take them for walks and they will not wake you up with barking.</p>

   <p>Dogs are the best pet becuase they love to interact with people and get their attention.
   Unlike cats who will ignore you half the time. Dogs also keep you fit by going on walks. As well you can throw a ball for them or just let them chase you.</p>

   <p>dogs aren't just good for being loveable pets though, you can train dogs for lots of different things. dogs can compete in competitions or shows dogs also are trained to help the police, as well certain dogs like huskies pull sleds</p>
